.. _whatsnew_0162:

Version 0.16.2 (June 12, 2015)
------------------------------

{{ header }}


This is a minor bug-fix release from 0.16.1 and includes a large number of
bug fixes along some new features (:meth:`~DataFrame.pipe` method), enhancements, and performance improvements.

We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Highlights include:

- A new ``pipe`` method, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0162.enhancements.pipe>`
- Documentation on how to use numba_ with *pandas*, see :ref:`here <enhancingperf.numba>`

Pipe
^^^^

We've introduced a new method :meth:`DataFrame.pipe`. As suggested by the name, ``pipe``
should be used to pipe data through a chain of function calls.
The goal is to avoid confusing nested function calls like

.. code-block:: python

   # df is a DataFrame
   # f, g, and h are functions that take and return DataFrames
   f(g(h(df), arg1=1), arg2=2, arg3=3)  # noqa F821

The logic flows from inside out, and function names are separated from their keyword arguments.
This can be rewritten as

.. code-block:: python

   (
       df.pipe(h)  # noqa F821
       .pipe(g, arg1=1)  # noqa F821
       .pipe(f, arg2=2, arg3=3)  # noqa F821
   )

Now both the code and the logic flow from top to bottom. Keyword arguments are next to
their functions. Overall the code is much more readable.

In the example above, the functions ``f``, ``g``, and ``h`` each expected the DataFrame as the first positional argument.
When the function you wish to apply takes its data anywhere other than the first argument, pass a tuple
of ``(function, keyword)`` indicating where the DataFrame should flow. For example:

.. ipython:: python

   import statsmodels.formula.api as sm

   bb = pd.read_csv("data/baseball.csv", index_col="id")

   # sm.ols takes (formula, data)
   (
       bb.query("h > 0")
       .assign(ln_h=lambda df: np.log(df.h))
       .pipe((sm.ols, "data"), "hr ~ ln_h + year + g + C(lg)")
       .fit()
       .summary()
   )

The pipe method is inspired by unix pipes, which stream text through
processes. More recently dplyr_ and magrittr_ have introduced the
popular ``(%>%)`` pipe operator for R_.

See the :ref:`documentation <basics.pipe>` for more. (:issue:`10129`)

.. _whatsnew_0162.enhancements.other:

Other enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added ``rsplit`` to Index/Series StringMethods (:issue:`10303`)

- Removed the hard-coded size limits on the ``DataFrame`` HTML representation
  in the IPython notebook, and leave this to IPython itself (only for IPython
  v3.0 or greater). This eliminates the duplicate scroll bars that appeared in
  the notebook with large frames (:issue:`10231`).

  Note that the notebook has a ``toggle output scrolling`` feature to limit the
  display of very large frames (by clicking left of the output).
  You can also configure the way DataFrames are displayed using the pandas
  options, see here :ref:`here <options.frequently_used>`.

- ``axis`` parameter of ``DataFrame.quantile`` now accepts also ``index`` and ``column``. (:issue:`9543`)

.. _whatsnew_0162.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Holiday`` now raises ``NotImplementedError`` if both ``offset`` and ``observance`` are used in the constructor instead of returning an incorrect result (:issue:`10217`).


.. _whatsnew_0162.performance:

- Improved ``Series.resample`` performance with ``dtype=datetime64[ns]`` (:issue:`7754`)
