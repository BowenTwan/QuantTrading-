****************
pandas ecosystem
****************

Increasingly, packages are being built on top of pandas to address specific needs
in data preparation, analysis and visualization.
This is encouraging because it means pandas is not only helping users to handle
their data tasks but also that it provides a better starting point for developers to
build powerful and more focused data tools.
The creation of libraries that complement pandas' functionality also allows pandas
development to remain focused around it's original requirements.

This is an inexhaustive list of projects that build on pandas in order to provide
tools in the PyData space. For a list of projects that depend on pandas,
see the
`libraries.io usage page for pandas <https://libraries.io/pypi/pandas/usage>`_
or `search pypi for pandas <https://pypi.org/search/?q=pandas>`_.

We'd like to make it easier for users to find these projects, if you know of other
substantial projects that you feel should be on this list, please let us know.

Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating Jupyter notebooks.
A Jupyter notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list
of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots
and rich media.
Jupyter notebooks can be converted to a number of open standard output formats
(HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown,
Python) through 'Download As' in the web interface and ``jupyter convert``
in a shell.

pandas DataFrames implement ``_repr_html_`` and ``_repr_latex`` methods
which are utilized by Jupyter Notebook for displaying
(abbreviated) HTML or LaTeX tables. LaTeX output is properly escaped.
(Note: HTML tables may or may not be
compatible with non-HTML Jupyter output formats.)

See :ref:`Options and Settings <options>` and
:ref:`Available Options <options.available>`

The ``modin.pandas`` DataFrame is a parallel and distributed drop-in replacement
for pandas. This means that you can use Modin with existing pandas code or write
new code with the existing pandas API. Modin can leverage your entire machine or
cluster to speed up and scale your pandas workloads, including traditionally
time-consuming tasks like ingesting data (``read_csv``, ``read_excel``,
``read_parquet``, etc.).

.. code:: python

    # import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv("big.csv")  # use all your cores!

`Odo <http://odo.pydata.org>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odo provides a uniform API for moving data between different formats. It uses
pandas own ``read_csv`` for CSV IO and leverages many existing packages such as
PyTables, h5py, and pymongo to move data between non pandas formats. Its graph

It can calculate statistics such as mean, sum, count, standard deviation etc, on an N-dimensional grid up to a billion (10\ :sup:`9`) objects/rows per second. Visualization is done using histograms, density plots and 3d volume rendering, allowing interactive exploration of big data. Vaex uses memory mapping, zero memory copy policy and lazy computations for best performance (no memory wasted).

 * vaex.from_pandas
 * vaex.to_pandas_df

.. _ecosystem.extensions:

Extension data types
--------------------

pandas provides an interface for defining
