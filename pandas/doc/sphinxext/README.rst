sphinxext
=========

This directory contains copies of different sphinx extensions in use in the
pandas documentation. These copies originate from other projects:

- ``numpydoc`` - Numpy's Sphinx extensions: this can be found at its own
  repository: https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc
- ``ipython_directive`` and ``ipython_console_highlighting`` in the folder
  ``ipython_sphinxext`` - Sphinx extensions from IPython: these are included
  in IPython: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/sphinxext

.. note::

    These copies are maintained at the respective projects, so fixes should,
    to the extent possible, be pushed upstream instead of only adapting our
    local copy to avoid divergence between the local and upstream version.
